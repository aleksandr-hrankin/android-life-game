# Game of Life
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.<br>

The universe of the Game of Life is an two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states,<br> 
live or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally,<br> 
vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:<br>

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.<br>
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.<br>
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.<br>
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.<br>

# The application implements the functionality<br>
##### Action with grid:<br>
  - Ð¡lear field
  - Fill the field with random cells
  - Increase / decrease field
##### Action with time::<br>
  - Increase / decrease the generation time of a new generation
##### Action with generation::<br>
  - Enable / disable infinite generation
  - Generate only next generation

# Technologies used<br>
  Java, XML, Gradle, Git
